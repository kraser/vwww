# My Vagrant Webserver

If you want to use this currently you need to have installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [parallels desktop developer edition](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) or [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org).

I'm a bit frustrated with MAMP and with configuring a serve on my computer, I feel like this should be a good compromise between the two.
